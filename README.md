# Gfless-python
Simple python implementation of Gfless by Hatz https://github.com/hatz02/GflessClient

# Warning
This was meant to be a simple script that I intendet for my personal use.
It does not have a GUI, so it will be hard to navigate.
There also might be some issues with the code, so I do not reccomend to use as is.
