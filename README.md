# Gfless-python
Simple python implementation of Hatzes Gfless https://github.com/hatz02/GflessClient

# Warning
This was meant to be a simple script that I intended for my personal use.\n
It does not have a GUI, so it will be hard to navigate.\n
There also might be some issues with the code, so I do not reccomend to use as is and I most likely won't maintain the code if some issues arise.\n
It will also require you to modify/create your own nostaleLogin, since the paths in the one included are hardcoded.\n
